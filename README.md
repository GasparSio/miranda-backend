# Dashboard Miranda Hotel Backend

**Dashboard Miranda Hotel Backend** is the backend component developed for the fifth project during my Fullstack Developer training at Oxygen Academy. This backend is built using Node.js and the Express library, providing controllers and services to handle CRUD requests from the Dashboard Miranda Hotel web application.

### Technologies Used
`Node.js`, `Express`, `MongoDB`

### Key Features:
- Implements controllers and services to handle CRUD operations from the Dashboard Miranda Hotel.
- Connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.
- Enables seamless communication between the web application and the backend.
- The backend also supports a separate branch (mysql-backend) where MySQL is used instead of MongoDB. Switch to this branch to explore the MySQL implementation.

### Installation and Setup:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
